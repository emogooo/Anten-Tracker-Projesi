# UAV-Antenna-Tracker

This project involves developing an antenna tracking system designed to facilitate communication between Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and their control stations. The system uses real-time data to continuously orient the antenna towards the UAV, ensuring a stable and reliable communication link. By accurately tracking the UAV's position the antenna can maintain optimal signal strength and quality throughout the flight. This is crucial for mission-critical operations where uninterrupted communication is essential. The system can adjust for changes in the UAV's altitude, speed, and direction, providing dynamic and responsive tracking capabilities.
